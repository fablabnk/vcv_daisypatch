# Daisy Patch for VCV Rack: SynthLab Additions

I forked this repo and updated it in order to allow us to build virtual VCV rack plugins with DaisySP code. The original version and instructions are [here](https://github.com/Segfault1602/vcv_daisypatch)

Before trying to 'make', don't forget to:
```
export RACK_SDK=/where/you/installed/Rack-SDK
git submodule init
git submodule update 
```
